# Instagram Clone



  - User authentication implemented using **Devise**
  - Uploading of Photos using **ActiveStorage**
  - Using **Cloudinary** for storage
  - **Cloudinary** key has to be written in .env file as it was added to gitignore file by me.
  - Just a single integration test using **MiniTest** using **Devise Integration Helpers** to to check if index.html is accessible without signing in
